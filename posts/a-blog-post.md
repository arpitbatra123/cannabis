I was originally drawn to Tech Twitter when I found a handful of users who shared genuinely helpful tips, articles, and resources with their audience. Before Twitter forced me to sign up to view tweets, I would anonymously check in on these accounts in my free time, pick up a few useful tricks, share them in my small circle of friends, and apply my newfound knowledge both at work and in my own projects. Twitter wasn't all that bad when I was just lurking.

The problem began when I decided to become actively involved on Twitter—to engage with these posts, connect with other developers, grow my network, and share things that I had learned or was working on. But I was also naive and wanted—like so many people do—to be noticed and to earn the approval of complete strangers. Everyone else seemed to be having a great time on Twitter, and I felt like I was missing out and maybe even holding myself back professionally.

> Once I reached a certain number of followers that seemed like a big deal to me—and once I was followed by people whom I respected and looked up to—I realized that I had also lost a part of myself in the process.Whereas I had originally started writing because I enjoyed the process of documenting my thoughts, learning process, and experiences, I was now writing less for myself and more for others.

The voice in my head suddenly found itself in the company of many other voices, each with their own flavor of disapproval. I cared less about what I thought of my writing and more about the various ways in which a reader could pick apart my work. It was because of Twitter that I began to weigh my word choices more carefully, sometimes to the point that I would spend minutes composing a message to get it just right. To quell my boredom, I would scroll mindlessly through a sea of overcommunication, of overstimulation, often several times a day and sometimes just minutes apart from previous sessions.

In short, I became addicted to Twitter.
